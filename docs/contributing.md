# Contributing to SDD Superpowers

This guide is for developers working on the sdd-superpowers plugin itself.
For using the plugin in your own project, see `CLAUDE.md`.

## What Is SDD?

SDD inverts the traditional relationship between specs and code. Instead of writing code and hoping it matches intent, you write precise specifications first, then generate code from them. The spec is the authoritative artifact; code is its expression in a particular language and framework.

Key principles:
- **Specifications as lingua franca** — PRD and implementation plan are the primary artifacts
- **Executable specifications** — specs are precise enough to generate working, testable code
- **Test-first always** — no implementation code without a prior failing test
- **Traceability** — every technical decision traces back to a specific requirement
- **Evidence before assertions** — no completion claims without running verification commands

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `sdd-workflow` | Start of any conversation — establishes mandatory skill invocation |
| `sdd-brainstorm` | Idea is fuzzy/exploratory → dialogue + 2-3 approaches + design.md |
| `sdd-specify` | Idea is clear, or design.md exists → structured PRD (spec.md) |
| `sdd-research` | Unresolved tech choices, performance/security requirements before planning |
| `sdd-plan` | Spec exists → architecture, contracts, data models, test-first plan |
| `sdd-tasks` | Plan exists → flat executable task list with parallelization hints |
| `sdd-execute` | Tasks exist → subagent dispatch with spec-compliance + code-quality review |
| `sdd-spec-update` | Change or addition to an approved spec → classify impact (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR), version spec, propagate downstream |
| `sdd-review` | Spec completeness check (pre-plan) or implementation alignment (post-execute) |

## Quick Start (for plugin contributors)

```
# Fuzzy idea path:
1. "Use sdd-brainstorm to explore: [your idea]"
2. Answer questions, pick from 2-3 approaches, approve design
3. sdd-brainstorm automatically invokes sdd-specify (fast-path)

# Clear idea path:
1. "Use sdd-specify to create a spec for: [your idea]"
2. Answer clarifying questions, approve the spec
3. "Use sdd-plan to plan this feature"
4. "Use sdd-tasks to generate the task list"
5. "Use sdd-execute to implement it"
6. "Use sdd-review to validate the implementation"
```
