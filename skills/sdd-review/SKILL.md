# SDD: Review

Validate that what was built matches what was specified. Catch drift between spec and implementation before it becomes technical debt.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the sdd-review skill to validate spec-implementation alignment."

**Core principle:** In SDD, the spec is truth. If code and spec disagree, one of three things happened: the code is wrong, the spec needs updating, or requirements changed and both need to change together. This skill surfaces that disagreement so it can be resolved consciously.

## Two Review Modes

### Mode A: Spec Review (pre-implementation)

Use before running `sdd-plan` to validate the spec is complete and implementable.

**Trigger:** "Review the spec for feature NNN before we plan."

### Mode B: Implementation Review (post-implementation)

Use after `sdd-tasks` execution to validate the code matches the spec.

**Trigger:** "Review the implementation for feature NNN."

---

## Mode A: Spec Review

### Step 1: Read the Spec

Read `specs/<NNN>-<feature-slug>/spec.md` in full.

### Step 2: Completeness Check

Work through each section systematically:

**Problem Statement:**
- [ ] Is the problem specific enough to define scope?
- [ ] Does it explain who is affected and why it matters?

**Goals:**
- [ ] Are all goals measurable? ("users can search" → measurable; "better UX" → not measurable)
- [ ] Does achieving all goals equal a successful feature?

**Non-Goals:**
- [ ] Are there obvious adjacent features not explicitly excluded?
- [ ] Could a developer reasonably think an out-of-scope feature was required?

**User Stories:**
- [ ] Does each story have acceptance criteria?
- [ ] Is each acceptance criterion testable (can be written as a passing/failing automated test)?
- [ ] Are there edge cases missing? (empty states, error states, permission boundaries)

**Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] Does every user story map to at least one FR?
- [ ] Are there any FRs with no corresponding user story? (scope creep risk)
- [ ] Are "must" and "must not" statements specific enough to implement?

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] Are performance targets concrete? (`< 200ms` vs. "should be fast")
- [ ] Are security requirements specific? ("authenticated users only" vs. "secure")

**Error Scenarios:**
- [ ] Does the spec cover: invalid input, missing data, permission denied, service failures?
- [ ] Is the expected behavior for each error scenario defined?

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Are all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items truly open, or can they be answered from context?
- [ ] Are these questions blocking implementation or can they be deferred?

### Step 3: Ambiguity Scan

Search for these red flags:
- Vague quantifiers: "fast", "good", "appropriate", "reasonable", "standard"
- Implicit assumptions: "obviously", "of course", "as usual"
- Missing subjects: "should validate" (validate what? validate how?)
- Undefined terms: domain vocabulary used without definition

For each red flag found: either resolve it or add a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker.

### Step 4: Implementation Feasibility Check

Would a skilled developer be able to implement this spec without asking questions?

Check for:
- [ ] All inputs and outputs defined for every user interaction
- [ ] Data relationships implied but not stated (if spec mentions "user's orders", is a User-Order relationship defined?)
- [ ] State transitions clear (if something can be "active" or "inactive", what triggers transitions?)

### Step 5: Report

Present findings as:

```
## Spec Review: <Feature Name>

### Overall Assessment
<READY TO PLAN | NEEDS REVISION>

### Issues Found

#### Critical (blocking)
- <Specific issue> — Location: <section>
  Suggested fix: <concrete suggestion>

#### Important (should fix before planning)
- <Specific issue> — Location: <section>
  Suggested fix: <concrete suggestion>

#### Minor (can address during planning)
- <Specific issue> — Location: <section>

### Confirmed Complete
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria ✓
- [ ] Performance requirements are measurable ✓
- [ ] Error scenarios are defined ✓
- ...
```

---

## Mode B: Implementation Review

### Step 1: Load All Artifacts

Read:
1. `specs/<NNN>-<feature-slug>/spec.md`
2. `specs/<NNN>-<feature-slug>/plan.md`
3. `specs/<NNN>-<feature-slug>/tasks.md`
4. All source files referenced in the plan
5. All test files referenced in the plan

### Step 2: Requirements Coverage

For every acceptance criterion in the spec:
- Find the test that verifies it
- Confirm that test passes
- Confirm the test actually exercises the production code path (not a mock of it)

Build a coverage matrix:

| Acceptance Criterion | Test File:Line | Status |
|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| <AC text> | `tests/path/test.ts:42` | PASS / MISSING / FAILING |

### Step 3: Spec Drift Detection

Check for implementation decisions that weren't in the spec:

**Extra functionality:** Does the code do anything the spec doesn't require? (not always bad, but should be explicit)

**Missing functionality:** Is anything in the spec not implemented?

**Behavior differences:** Does the implementation behave differently from the spec for any scenario?
- Different error messages than spec defines
- Different response shapes than contracts specify
- Different validation rules than FRs define

### Step 4: Contract Validation

For every API contract in `contracts/`:
- [ ] Request shape matches what the implementation accepts
- [ ] Response shape matches what the implementation returns
- [ ] All error codes are implemented and triggered by the documented conditions

### Step 5: Non-Functional Requirements Check

For each NFR in the spec:
- **Performance:** Were performance tests run? Do they pass?
- **Security:** Is authentication/authorization implemented as specified?
- **Reliability:** Are error handling and recovery implemented?

### Step 6: Report

```
## Implementation Review: <Feature Name>

### Overall Assessment
<SPEC-ALIGNED | DRIFT DETECTED | INCOMPLETE>

### Coverage Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| <FR-1 or AC> | ✓ Covered | |
| <FR-2 or AC> | ✗ Missing | No test found |
| <FR-3 or AC> | ⚠ Partial | Test exists but doesn't cover edge case |

### Drift Issues

#### Implementation Exceeds Spec (undocumented features)
- <What was built that wasn't specified>
  Decision needed: update spec to document, or remove from implementation?

#### Implementation Falls Short of Spec (missing features)
- <What was specified but not implemented>
  Action: implement or defer with explicit scope change?

#### Behavior Differences
- <Spec says X, implementation does Y>
  Action: fix implementation or update spec?

### Recommended Actions

1. <Specific action with file reference>
2. <Specific action with file reference>

### Confirmed Aligned
- ✓ <requirement that is correctly implemented>
```

### Step 7: Handoff

If SPEC-ALIGNED:
> "Implementation review complete — all requirements covered and implementation matches spec. Feature is ready for merge/release."

If DRIFT DETECTED or INCOMPLETE:
> "Review found issues. Address the items above, then re-run `sdd-review` to confirm alignment before merging."

## Review Quality Standards

**Cite specific locations:** Every issue must reference the spec section AND the code file/line where the problem is found. "The spec says X in FR-3, but the implementation in `src/auth.ts:47` does Y."

**Distinguish facts from opinions:** "This function is missing the null check required by FR-2" is a fact. "This could be written more cleanly" is an opinion. Report only facts.

**Don't suggest refactoring:** The review's job is spec-implementation alignment, not code quality. If code is technically correct and matches the spec, it passes review.
