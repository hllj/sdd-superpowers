# SDD: Tasks

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the sdd-tasks skill to generate the task list."

## Overview

Convert an implementation plan into a flat, ordered, executable task list with parallelization hints. Tasks are the atomic unit of SDD execution — each has unambiguous done criteria, complete code, and an exact verification command.

<examples>
<example>
<context>plan.md was just written but the user has not yet reviewed or approved it.</context>
<correct>Do NOT generate tasks yet. Present plan.md and wait for explicit approval before generating the task list.</correct>
<incorrect>Generate tasks immediately after plan.md is saved — unreviewed plans produce task lists that encode unvalidated decisions.</incorrect>
</example>
</examples>

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT generate tasks until ALL of the following are true:
1. `plan.md` exists at `docs/specs/NNN-slug/plan.md`
2. The user has explicitly approved the plan in this session
3. `spec.md` status is `Approved` (not `Draft`)

If the plan exists but hasn't been approved: present it and wait for explicit confirmation before generating any tasks.
</HARD-GATE>

## When to Use

- `plan.md` exists and the user has explicitly approved it
- You want to track progress or dispatch agents
- NOT before a plan exists — run `sdd-superpowers:sdd-plan` first

## Quick Reference

Task anatomy — one task = one atomic action:

| Step | Example task |
|------|-------------|
| Write test | "Write failing unit test for `<function>`" (with complete test code) |
| Verify RED | "Run `<exact command>` — expect: FAIL `<reason>`" |
| Implement | "Implement `<function>`" (with complete implementation) |
| Verify GREEN | "Run `<exact command>` — expect: PASS" |
| Commit | "`git commit -m 'feat: <description>'`" |

`[P]` marks tasks safe to run concurrently — they touch different files and have no shared dependencies.

After generating `tasks.md`, invokes `sdd-superpowers:using-git` for branch creation and doc-first commit.

See [reference.md](reference.md) for full derivation rules, tasks.md template (with parallel group format), validation checklist, and task quality rules.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

Each step is one action (2–5 minutes):
- "Write the failing test" — one step
- "Run it to verify it fails" — one step
- "Write minimal implementation" — one step
- "Run tests to verify they pass" — one step
- "Commit" — one step

## No Placeholders

These are task failures — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later"
- "Add error handling" / "handle edge cases" (without code)
- "Similar to Task N" — repeat the code; tasks may be read out of order
- Steps that reference types or functions not defined in any prior task
- Verification steps without an exact command and expected output

## Remember

- Exact file paths always — never relative or partial paths
- Complete code in every task — show the entire function, not just changed lines
- Exact commands with expected output — e.g. `pytest tests/foo.py::test_bar -v` / Expected: PASS
- Every implementation step must have a prior failing test step

## Integration

Required sub-skills:

| When | Sub-skill |
|------|-----------|
| Branch creation + doc-first commit after `tasks.md` is written | `sdd-superpowers:using-git` |

## Execution Handoff

After saving `tasks.md`, offer:

> "Task list complete. Next: run `sdd-superpowers:sdd-execute` to begin implementation."

## Constraints

- Does NOT generate tasks until plan.md exists and the user has explicitly approved it in the current session
- Does NOT generate tasks while spec.md status is Draft
- Does NOT produce a task with a "TBD", "TODO", or "similar to above" placeholder

## Error Handling

- **Plan has TBD or placeholder items**: Halt. Resolve placeholders in plan.md before generating tasks — tasks derived from incomplete plans are also incomplete.
- **Spec status is Draft**: Redirect to sdd-specify to obtain explicit approval before proceeding.
- **User requests gate bypass**: The gate is "no tasks without an approved plan." Explain that tasks built on an unapproved plan encode unvalidated decisions into the executable checklist. Offer to review the plan first.
